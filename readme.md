# Intro 
Kosdapapa is a test project in which I have ChatGPT create a piggy bank site for my daughters in which they can check whether they can buy something

# Features

You can define 2 names for your children. Currently only 2, no more, no less. Define them in the top of the script tag as childName1 and childName2.

Displaying the site will give you the option to show the piggy bank of 1 of the children. Once you open one, you can check see the balance of your piggy bank and enter the price of the item you wish to buy. Clicking the 'Check' button will show you a progress bar displaying how big a part of your savings you would spend buying this item. It also displays a result test which tells you how much savings you have left after buying the item.

# Dev challenge

I tried to get as much coding done by ChatGPT as possible. So just by trying to tell it what I wanted, what results I got, how I wanted it to look. Eventually, I needed quite some manual fixing...

I started some new threads to see whether it would significantly change (read: improve) my responses :) See ChatGPT threads:

        Github access and dynamic site
        CGPT was unable to access, dynamic site without framework got too complex.


# Based on Vanilla JavaScript App

[Azure Static Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/overview) allows you to easily build JavaScript apps in minutes. Use this repo with the [quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/getting-started?tabs=vanilla-javascript) to build and customize a new static site.

This repo is used as a starter for a _very basic_ HTML web application using no front-end frameworks.

This repo has a dev container. This means if you open it inside a [GitHub Codespace](https://github.com/features/codespaces), or using [VS Code with the remote containers extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers), it will be opened inside a container with all the dependencies already installed.
